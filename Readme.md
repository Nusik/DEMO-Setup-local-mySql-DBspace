1) Setup local mySql database space

2) Write test suite using JDBC with few dependent tests (10 tests) which will process next types of queries in next order (data in queries are on your decision):

CREATE DATABASE

CREATE TABLE

INSERT

SELECT

UPDATE

SELECT

DELETE

SELECT

DROP TABLE

*verify table was dropped

DROP DATABASE

*verify database was dropped
